# Lists in Python

## Goal:

- This exercise helps you to understand how to use `lists` and list's methods

### Methods:

- **append()**:  add a value to end of the list
- **count()**:  count a value in list
- **insert()**:  insert a value in a index
- **pop()**:  remove a index and return it
- **remove()**:  remove a value from list

### Example Output:

```sh
Create a list with 1, 2, 3 values: [1, 2, 3]
After appending three 6 to end of list: [1, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6]
How many 6 in lists: 3
After inserting Dimah to index 2: [1, 2, 'Dimah', 3, 6, 6, 6]
Value in index 5 was deleted: [1, 2, 'Dimah', 3, 6, 6]
But we have that in a variable: 6
After remove `dimah` from list: [1, 2, 3, 6, 6]
```
