## Define a class called Animal that has the following properties:

### Your Task:

- name (animal name)
- species (animal species)
- age (animal age)
- sound (animal sound)
- Then create an instance of this class for a "lion" and print its properties.

## Attributes and Class Keywords

### Your Task:

- Add a make_sound() method to the Animal class that prints the animal's sound.

## Class Object Attributes and Methods

### Your Task:

- Add a class attribute (zoo_name) that specifies the name of the zoo. Also, define an info() method that prints - the animal's information.

## Inheritance and Polymorphism

### Your task:

- Also, rewrite the make_sound() method so that the birds make different sounds.
