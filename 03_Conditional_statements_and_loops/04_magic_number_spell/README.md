## Magic Number Spell Exercise

In the land of wizards, there is an old spell that says that every magic number must have a special property:

- If a number is divisible by 3, it is considered a magic number.
- If a number is divisible by 5, it is considered a cursed number.
- If a number is both magical and cursed, it is considered a legendary number.
