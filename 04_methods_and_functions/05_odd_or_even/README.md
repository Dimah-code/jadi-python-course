## Even or Odd Exercise

In this exercise, you need to define a function called is_even that checks whether a given number is even or odd. This is a fundamental concept in mathematics and programming that is used in many problems.

### Your task:

Define a function called is_even(n) that:

- Takes an integer n as input.
- Checks whether the number is even or not.
- Returns True if the number is even.
- Returns False if the number is odd.
- The value should be returned, not printed directly.

### Input:
- An integer n read from the input.

### Output:
- A True value if the number is even.
- A False value if the number is odd.

### Sample Input 1:
```bash
 8
```

### Expected Output 1:
```bash
 True
