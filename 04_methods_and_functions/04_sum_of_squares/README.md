## Sum of Squares Exercise

In this exercise, you need to write a function that takes two integers and calculates the sum of their squares.

### Your task:
Write a function called sum_of_squares that takes two integers and returns the sum of the squares of those two numbers.

### Calculation formula:

- In math:
```math
f(a,b) = a^2 + b^2
```
- In python:
```python
 sum_of_squares(a, b) = a**2 + b**2
```

### Input:
- Two integers (int).

### Output:
- An integer that is the sum of the squares of the two input numbers.

### Sample Input 1:
```sh
3
4
```

### Expected Output 1:
```sh
25
```

### Sample Input 2:
```sh
5
