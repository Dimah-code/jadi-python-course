## Magic Ring

A wizard has decided to increase the power of numbers by using a special spell! He chooses a number n as the number of steps and a number x on which to perform the operation. He then does the following:

- If the number is odd, he doubles its value and subtracts 1 unit.
- If the number is even, he halves its value.
- The wizard performs this operation exactly n times.

### Input:

- An integer n that specifies the number of steps (1 ≤ n ≤ 20).
- An integer x that is the initial value (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000).

### Output:

Finally, display the final value of x.

### Sample input:
```sh
 5
 10
```

### Sample output:
```sh
 65
```
