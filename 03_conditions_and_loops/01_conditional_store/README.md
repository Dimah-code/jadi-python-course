## Conditional Store

A store offers special discounts to its customers. The discount rules are as follows:

- If the purchase amount is more than 50,000$, a 20% discount is applied.
- If the purchase amount is between 20,000$ and 50,000$, a 10% discount is applied.
- If the purchase amount is less than 20,000$, no discount is applied.

Write a program that receives the purchase amount from the user and displays the final amount.
