## Magic Machine Exercise

We have a machine called the "Magic Machine" that takes a prime number n and wants to get to 1. The machine can do two things:

- If the current number is divisible by 2, it halve it.

- If the current number is not divisible by 2, it multiplies the number by 3 and adds 1 to it.

### Your task
Write a program that takes the prime number n as input and show how the machine gets to 1.

### Input:

An integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000)

### Output:

At each step, print the current value of n until the number reaches 1.

### Sample input:
```sh
 50
```

### Sample output:
```sh
 50
