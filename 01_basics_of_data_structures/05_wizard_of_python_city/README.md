## The Wizard of Python Exercise

A wizard has two magical sets called SetA and SetB.
Each set contains several unique numbers.

```python
  SetA = {1, 2, 3, 4}
  SetB = {3, 4, 5, 6}
```

The wizard must perform two magical operations:

Find all elements that appear in either SetA or SetB — this is called the union.

Find all elements that appear in both SetA and SetB — this is called the intersection.

## Your Task

Write a Python program that:

Finds the union of the two sets and stores it in a variable named u.

Finds the intersection of the two sets and stores it in a variable named i.

Prints both results on separate lines in the following format:

```python
  Union: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
  Intersection: {3, 4}
```
