## Distance Between Two Points Exercise (Using a Tuple) 

- Create a tuple named coordinates that represents the coordinates of point A on a plane
- for example, point A(4, 3) → coordinates = (4, 3).

Then, write code to calculate the distance between this point and the origin (0, 0).

To calculate the distance between two points in a coordinate plane, use the Euclidean distance formula:

```txt
  distance = √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²)
```
