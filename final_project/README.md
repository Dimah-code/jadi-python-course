# To-Do List Management

In this project, you will create a To-Do List management application that uses various Python concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), reading and writing CSV files, and data management. The project includes the ability to add, delete, and view tasks, as well as save and load to-do lists from a CSV file.

## Project Features:

- Add New Task: A new task is added to the list.

- Remove Task: A task is removed from the list.

- View To-Do List: All tasks in the list are displayed.

- Save To-Do List to CSV File: All tasks are automatically saved to a CSV file.

- Load from CSV File: The to-do list is automatically loaded from a CSV file.
- Select Priority for Tasks: Each task can have a priority (e.g., high, medium, or low).

## Project Details:

You should use object-oriented to manage tasks. Create classes for Task and ToDoList.
Use CSV file to store and load data.
The project should use context menu to perform various operations (add task, delete task, view tasks and save list).

## Application structure:

Task class to model each task:
